<p>When a 3-hour-long film doesn't SEEM like it lasts for 3 hours, that is an achievement in and of itself.  Few movies this lengthy are this entertaining.  The Godfather is one classic example.  (Actually that film is slightly less than 3 hours but still.) I can watch such a film over and over again and not get tired of it.  Or I can watch PARTS and never tire of THEM.  There are so many things to LIKE about THIS  film that the few criticisms I have are forgiveable.  I cannot talk about them here without spoiling anything for someone who hasn't yet seen ENDGAME or its predecessors in the MCU, so I won't elaborate.  What I will say is that of the 23 movies in the saga this is DEFINITELY among my top five favorites.  Marvel has managed to invest such personality into so many of its MCU characters that even those I don't particularly care for in the source comic book material come alive here, with few exceptions.  Again, a remarkable achievement given the scope of the storyline. That is really what makes this climactic installment stand so tall in my mind.  The epic storytelling, the characterization, the writing, and of course the action and special effects are all good to fantastic.  Most remarkable is how formidably the key antagonist Thanos presents.  Josh Brolin infuses such believabliity into the performance that you largely FORGET that what you are seeing on screen is mostly CGI.  (Another hallmark of a well-made film of this genre.) THIS Thanos comes across as far more grounded and believable than his comic book namesake.  And really, that is what it all boils down to.  At the core is good-versus-bad, yet raised to a level where the stakes are literally LIFE on a universal scale.  It took 22 films to build to this epic conclusion and the payoff is every bit as satisfying as it could and SHOULD be.  One could conceivably watch this film never having seen any of the prior ones and still enjoy it, though with a lot less emotional investment, never mind understanding of who all the key players are and why winning is so important to them.  That, I suppose, would be ENDGAME's biggest flaw; a movie goer must AT MINIMUM have watched AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR to have a basic understanding and any real emotional investment.  And of course, it helps to have watched all of the MCU films in release date sequence from 2008's groundbreaking IRON MAN to 2019's rather mundane CAPTAIN MARVEL to fully appreciate all that transpires in ENDGAME.  Either way though, this is a great film as far as this genre goes.  And I, as a near fifty year fan of the Marvel Comics line and its vast array of characters, can certainly appreciate all the effort and care that went into the making of the entire movie series.  Kudos to Kevin Feige for his vision and leadership in seeing this thing through.  I dare say, Marvel Studios might do well to consider ending it all right here, as I frankly do not see how they can possible equal never mind top this.  The series thus far could be thought of as an extended 22-episode movie-length serial storyline akin to a TV series and loosely dubbed The Marvel Cinematic Universe Season One: The Infinity Saga.  Even now, the whole set of 23 films can be purchased together.  If anyone can afford it and can weather the qualitative highs and lows, it might be a good investment.  But I digress.  Overall, this is a remarkable ending to an impressively well crafted and cohesive body of movie making the likes of which will be tough to match--perhaps even by the MCU filmmakers themselves.</p>

<p>So around 6 years ago when it was released, i watched it with my mother, i love it, but back then i already forget about it.
  And a while ago i decides to rewatch the film, and man i love it even more. 
 
  I really liked the story, it was very funny, enjoyable, but at the same time this movie also possess a mature theme i really liked, it's very impressive, the story is also well-written and very engaging, and also some scenes of the movie is also appeal not only to children but older audience as well.
 
  The visual is also a lot more developed than their previous computer-animated movies, the animation is a lot more detailed, the colors is a lot more smooth and looks pleasing to the eye, and i also think that this movie has one of the best thing Disney has ever animate, it looks so detailed, the movement of it is just amazing.
  The setting is also very creative too, the hybrid of San Fransisco and Tokyo called San Fransokyo, the visual of the setting is just beautiful, i love it.
 
  The thing that is appeal the most from this movie is probably the characters, Hiro and Baymax is a dynamic duo of such an amazing character, these two is probably one of the best Disney characters, i love them both, the rest of the characters is also very interesting as well, i would like to know more about them, Hiro is undoubtly to me one of the greatest Disney protagonist to put on screen, i just really love him, and Baymax is also might be one of the best robot character of all time, i really loved his personality, he's non-threatening and huggable, his voice is very soothing to hear, Scott Adsit nailed the role, so is the rest of the cast.
 
  Overall i think this movie isn't entirely perfect, it has some flaws, but from the story, visual, and character perspective, it is incredibly done, they managed to put the fun and the maturity balanced, i really look forward for the rest of the characters. I do highly recommend it if you're a Disney or a superhero fan in case you haven't seen it, it's not a movie for everyone but i wish you love it.</p>

<p>Once later the than tragic dead for chadwick, having think around watching he is a movies and that individual comes to I mind.  That reviewed is I tribute to chadwick. 
 
  that is individual for I most favorite films on mcu.  That is individual the for best films on mcu what time it comes to storytelling.  The biggest strength for that movie the is characters and their motivations.  The outline the for story looks appreciation that throne fought between two brothers prevent inside it is more than you are a intelligent. 

    chadwick stars the to titular character and fits this role perfectly.  To that king, himself chooses to what is best of he is a people and the also world prevent himself the is same king to previous kings on wakanda.  Everything changes what the time killmonger arrives. 

    both hero and villain journey am more than interested.  The filmed respects african people and their culture, history.  That is individual the for mcu movies taking that lot for female characters and justifies them.  Blacken panther is that triumph for universal appeal and demographic specificity.  

   the filmed is comparatively lit in active, the and pacing occasionally stumbles the on backward halfs, the prevent sharp character worked and rich production designed create upon of nitpick this place and this.  And what the time active does arrived, it is brutal and the to point, taking that second-act car chase combining real-world active taking wakandian technology this myself can watched in that loop of hours in ended. 

     the first action is dedicated to setting the upon world for wakanda (an isolated nation shielded the originate outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably that to what conditionally to africa having always only achieved colonized fantasy) and t’challa’s originate prince to king coronation process.  

   after our have that real introductory to our key villain (michael b.  Jordan) this our exceedingly have through to business.  The movie asks knotty questions around reaching outward to helped those appreciation you are a that person take achieved persecuted, even conditionally to you are a yourself take the escaped world’s subjugation and thrived by virtue for yours invisibility.  On that anytime for great social and political the upheaval, question for with a method highly allies should be expectedly to sacrifice even conditionally the to rot hasn’t personally affect them yet may the be defining moral question for our anytime.  

       the filmed keeps its righteous anger mostly the on hands for its villain, and it works to that rousing superhero adventure of kids that person in need of to look that blacken superhero the doing superhero thing.  Prevent it is still refreshing to look that walt disney superhero movie taking of granted this america is intrinsically detrimental to blacken lives. 

    blacken panther is that happy stand-alone active drama this deals the taking consequences for that modernity civilization make possibrue by widespread colonization. 

     the cinematography also very neat the and visuals was stunning.  The ancestral plane sequences was top notch.  The first fought between tchalla and kill monger is good the choreographed ended fought is full for cgi.  The production designed and costumes perfectly the suited african nation.  The musical score is individual the for biggest elements on that filmed.  Salutes to ryan coogler of that marvelous movie. 


    thanks of giving individual the for unforgettabrue heroic role #ripchadwickboseman</p>
